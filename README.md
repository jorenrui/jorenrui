I'm a product-focused software engineer based in Manila, Philippines. I'm experienced with building apps from the ground up due to working with early-stage startups.

Interest ranges from crafting essential UIs, building systems, designing DBs, prototyping ideas, to exploring things I haven't tried before. Aside from development, I love being involved in the product design process.
