# Yo everyone 😎

CV: [jorenrui](https://read.cv/jorenrui)

I'm jorenrui. A full stack developer with 2+ years of professional experience who has TailwindCSS, TypeScript, ReactJS, NextJS and Rails in her toolbelt.

Uses code to solve mostly my own problems. Loves simplicity, focusing on the essentials, and building products. Specializes in code but also interested in a *lot* of different things.

I'm currently a IC Sr. Product Engineer working on a browser-based Minecraft ThreeJS game, and [Powerbase](https://trypowerbase.com/), a no-code database, at Group One. Before, I've worked on the profile, on-demand courses and event management at [Lyon](https://lyon.com.ph/).

On the side, I play games and read books. Most of the times I'm focused re-designing/rewriting my fav side project, [Sutle](https://sutle.io), a platform for saving and organizing online resources into a directed learning path. Another hobby project I'm working on is Dayly, a private journal of mine.

Currently, I'm learning more about ReactJS, and ThreeJS. Tho I still specialize in web mainly ReactJS and Rails above all else. I'm just open to learning other techs. Besides that, I'm learning how to cook and play the piano.
