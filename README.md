# Yo everyone 😎

I'm jorenrui. Product-focused full stack developer with 3.5+ years of professional experience who has TailwindCSS, TypeScript, React.js, Next.js and Rails in her toolbelt.

Uses code to solve mostly my own problems. Loves simplicity, focusing on the essentials, and building products. Specializes in code but also interested in a *lot* of different things.

Currently working as a Sr. IC Product Engineer on a ThreeJS browser-based sandbox game at Novablocks, previously at [Tonic Labs](https://workwithtonic.com/).

I'm experienced with building products from the ground up due to working with early-stage startups.

On the side, I'm building [Suikun UI](https://suikunui.joeylene.com/), my own UI kit, and [Sutle](https://sutle.io/), a platform for organizing resources into a directed learning path.

Interests includes but not limited to:
- product design, UI/UX, web development, game development, and game design.
- traveling, reading manga / manhwa, writing / building stuff, and playing video games.
