# Yo everyone 😎

> Currently in a hiatus. For now, you can find me focused on my work and relaxing by streaming games on Twitch.

I'm a Full Stack Developer who has a thing for simplicity, knowledge, and problem solving ✨ Currently, I'm in the realm of TypeScript, NextJS, NodeJS, and Rails.

I help build MVPs of no-code tools and EdTech products. Interested in startups, product dev & design, and building a community. Experimenting on different ways of creating content starting with streaming on Twitch and writing at my Broken Rewind substack.
