# Yo everyone 😎

I'm jorenrui. Product-focused full stack developer with 4 years of professional experience.

I'm currently a Sr. Product Engineer working on a browser-native gaming platform at [Jamango!](https://jamango.io/). Before, I've worked on a no-code database at [Tonic Labs](https://workwithtonic.com/).

On the side, I play games and read books. Most of the times I'm focused working on my side projects, [Sutle](https://sutle.io/), a platform for saving and organizing online resources into a directed learning path and [Suikun UI](https://sui.joeylene.com/), a work-in-progress UI kit.
