# Yo everyone 😎

I'm jorenrui. Product-focused full stack developer with 3 years of professional experience who has TailwindCSS, TypeScript, ReactJS, NextJS and Rails in her toolbelt.

Uses code to solve mostly my own problems. Loves simplicity, focusing on the essentials, and building products. Specializes in code but also interested in a *lot* of different things.

I'm currently a IC Sr. Product Engineer working on a browser-based sandbox game, and a no-code database, at [Tonic Labs](http://toniclabs.ltd/). Before, I've worked on the profile, on-demand courses and event management at [Lyon](https://lyon.com.ph/).

On the side, I play games and read books. Most of the times I'm focused working on my side projects, sutle.io, a platform for saving and organizing online resources into a directed learning path and a UI library.

Currently, I'm learning more about ReactJS, and ThreeJS. Tho I still specialize in web mainly ReactJS and Rails above all else. I'm just open to learning other tech.
