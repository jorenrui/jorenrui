# Yo everyone 😎

Currently a Sr. IC Product Engineer working on a ThreeJS browser-based sandbox game and a no-code database. I'm experienced with building products from the ground up due to working with early-stage startups.

On the side, I'm building sutle.io, a platform for organizing resources into a directed learning path. I'm also building an MVP for a secret vault app idea of mine.

Mainly uses ReactJS, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, PostreSQL, and Rails but open to learning new things.

Currently at [Tonic Labs](http://toniclabs.ltd/), previously [Lyon](https://lyon.com.ph/).
