# Yo everyone 😎

I'm a Full Stack TypeScript Developer who has a thing for simplicity, knowledge, and problem solving ✨ Currently, I'm in the realm of TypeScript, ReactJS, NextJS, KoaJS, PostgreSQL and TypeORM.

I love reading and learning all sorts of fields other than coding. Currently, I'm educating myself on Economics 👀 Anddd am still figuring out adulting 😂

I work at [Lyon](https://lyon.com.ph/) and do some full stack magic. Feel free to reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jorenrui/) (within reason) or read some [articles I wrote](https://dev.to/jorenrui).
